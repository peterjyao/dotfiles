# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.

# Key bindings
#
# Each binding is defined as an object with some properties. Most of the
# properties are optional. All of the alphabetical keys should have a letter for
# the `key` value such as `V`. Function keys are probably what you would expect
# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as
# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,
# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.
#
# A list with all available `key` names can be found here:
# https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
# Possible values for `mods`
# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key
# `Control` for the control key
# `Shift` for the Shift key
# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option
#
# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift
# looks like:
#
# mods: Control|Shift
#
# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -
# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace
# around them.
#
# Either an `action`, `chars`, or `command` field must be present.
#   `action` must be one of `Paste`, `PasteSelection`, `Copy`, or `Quit`.
#   `chars` writes the specified string every time that binding is activated.
#     These should generally be escape sequences, but they can be configured to
#     send arbitrary strings of bytes.
#   `command` must be a map containing a `program` string, and `args` array of
#     strings. For example:
#     - { ... , command: { program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] } }

# Regex hints
#
# Terminal hints can be used to find text in the visible part of the terminal
# and pipe it to other applications.

  # List with all available hints
  #
  # Each hint must have a `regex` and either an `action` or a `command` field.
  # The fields `mouse`, `binding` and `post_processing` are optional.
  #
  # The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods` and `mouse.mods` accept
  # the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
  #
  # The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
  # the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
  #
  # If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
  # shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
  # (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs.
  #
  # Values for `action`:
  #   - Copy
  #       Copy the hint's text to the clipboard.
  #   - Paste
  #       Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search.
  #   - Select
  #       Select the hint's text.
  #   - MoveViModeCursor
  #       Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint.
